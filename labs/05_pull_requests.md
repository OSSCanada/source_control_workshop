# Pull Requests

Pull requests (aka "PR") allow us to submit our own changes back to a project which we may or may not own.

This is an important feature as it allows separation/segregation of code and allows us a mechanism for governance.  It's not the only way to do so but is a preferred one by most Open Source Projects.

We'll now submit a pull request back into the original Source Control Workshop that we forked from at the beginning of this lab.

## Let's make a PR
- Go to the original ```Source Control Workshop``` GitHub page and click on the "Pull Requests Tab"
- Now click on the green "New pull request" button on the right hand side
- Now choose to make a PR into the Original Project's Master from your Project's Master Branch
- Add any comments or information as to what you're making a PR for (i.e. this is a bug fix...you've added a new feature, you're addressing a known vulnerability...something else useful?)
- Once you've submitted the PR the maintainer(s) of the original Project will be notified and they will have the chance to review and then approve the changes
	- This helps maintainers ensure quality and gate updates...you don't want people adding malicious changes
- Once the PR has been approved, your chagnes are now part of the Original Project's history!
