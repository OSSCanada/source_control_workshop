# Forking

Forking allows us to make an independent copy of a repository into our own GitHub account or organization.  This allows for independent changes to be made without clobbering the original source code.  You can have a completely divergent project or commit your changes back to the "Upstream" source.

Let's for this repository (entire workshop) into your account.
