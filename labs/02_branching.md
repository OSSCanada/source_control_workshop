# Branching

Branching allows us another mechanism to make changes without polutting or interfering with our project and peers/collaborators.  Branching is associated with our current working repository and thus will not interfere with the original repository we have forked from.

Generally we will make our changes in our own branches ("feature" branches), merge them back to our master branch (this could also be a development or "release" branch...will explain this later) and then submit a pull request back to the original project (optional - only if you intend to contribute back to the orignal project).

You will often encounter questions from developers around branching strategies.  Please see [09_branching_and_flow_strategies](09_branching_and_flow_strategies.md) for more details.
